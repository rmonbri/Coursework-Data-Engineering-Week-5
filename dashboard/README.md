# Folder for dashboard / visualisations
A Streamlit dashboard that loads data from the RDS using pyodbc (due to various issues using pymssql).
The next steps for the dashboard are to integrate long-term data using the S3, then host on the cloud.
To run locally:
please run `streamlit run dashboard.py`
