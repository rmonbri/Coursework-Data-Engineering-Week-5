# Script for getting seed data
seed_data.py
This script scans the plant API 'https://data-eng-plants-api.herokuapp.com/plants/8' that receives and displays new plant environment data from Raspberry Pi sensors each minute. It outputs three .csv files, corresponding to the files needed to be seeded.

These files are then seeded using seed_database.py
